# LibreNMS Speedtest
A Speedtest plugin for LibreNMS, built with RRD and Speedtest CLI by Ookla

Introduction
------------
This is a plugin that enables internet uplink bandwidth graphing in a LibreNMS dashboard. It uses Ookla servers to perform the speedtest by calling Ookla's Speedtest CLI application. Data is stored in the backend into RRD and is visualized by using a LibreNMS style dashboard.
Installation should be pretty straight forward.<br/>
